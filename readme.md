# Repository for FVS and WRDM input, output, and log files

# Divide final BA output from FVS and WRDM by 4.356. (i.e. A2/4.356 = BA_meters_sq_per_hectare)

# Standard deviation formula (See "Apiary_calculations.xlsx" spreadsheet for example). Formula in excel is:  =STDEV(H2,H6,H10,H14,H18)/SQRT(COUNT(H2,H6,H10,H14,H18))
